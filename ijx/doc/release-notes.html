<li> <u>1.44f, 22 August 2010</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Grouped Z Project</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid,
<i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i> and <i>Image&gt;Scale</i>
now have "Average when downsizing" options.
<i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i> now supports Undo.
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, the Ortho Viewer (<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthogonal Views</i>)
can be controled by clicking and dragging in the XZ and YZ views and
the mouse wheel changes the screen plane in all three views..
<li> <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> now works with RGB hyperstacks.
<li> The headers are now saved when saving a DICOM virtual stack in TIFF format.
<li> Thanks to Mark Longair, IJ.getScreenSize() now returns the correct 
size when the screen size is changed after ImageJ has started.
<li> The perimeter of a composite selection is now calculated by decomposing it into
individual selections. The composite perimeter and the sum of the
individual perimeters may be different due to use of different calculation methods.
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, added getInstance(), getCrossLoc() and setCrossLoc() methods to the Orthogonal_Views class
(<a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/macros/js/OrthoViewsDemo.js">example</a>).
<li> SetStack() calls no longer cause a new ImageWindow
to be constructed when adding a slice to a single image or subtracting a slice
from a two slice stack. 
<li> Opened macro sets with two or more macros are installed in the
<i>Plugins&gt;Macros</i> submenu.
<li> Added the getInterpolationMethod() and resize(int,int,boolean) methods
to the ImageProcessor class.
<li> Fixed a regression than caused the particle analyzer to fail with stacks
when "Display labels" was enabled in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>.
<li> Fixed bugs in <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthogonal Views</i> that caused it
to not work correctly with anisotropic voxels.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Rotate</i> to fail with
wide lines.
</ul>
